# CS145-COVID-Liquor-Exploration
While the pandemic has wreaked havoc throughout the economy, there exist some businesses that have benefitted from the wide-spread social distancing. Social media giants and video software companies have all seen a modest increase in revenue in 2020. We are interested in these silver linings. In particular, we are interested to see if the liquor stores have benefited from the pandemic. Our hypothesis is that liquor consumption may have drastically changed during the pandemic as a result of an increase in social distancing and the closures of bars and clubs. Specifically, we hypothesize that liquor stores may have had an increase in revenue throughout this pandemic and that consumer patterns with liquor consumption has also changed.

To better understand this, we will look closely at Iowa liquor sales as a case study. We will be investigating the following questions.

How did liquor consumption in Iowa look like before the pandemic?
How did liquor consumption in Iowa change after the pandemic?
These high-level questions can be further broken down into more specific guiding questions. Specifically, we will want to investigate changes in liquor consumption in a variety of lenses. Namely, we would want to answer the following questions.

How has liquor consumption changed geographically?
How have consumer preferences changed?
How has the rate of consumption changed?
How has the price of liquor changed?
Answering these questions will be central in understanding how liquor industry has been affected by the pandemic.
